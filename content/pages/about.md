My name is Igor Shovkun, I am a PhD student in the Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering 
at the Unirsity of Texas at Austin. I received my BSc and MSc in Applied Physics and Mathematics in Russia
from the best technical university MIPT (no offence, MSU).   

During my career in research I have been involved in experimental and simulation projects
in the area of Petroleum Engineering mainly concerning fluid flow, geomechanical, and thermal processes. Please refer to my current [Resume](pages/resume.html) for more details concerning my background.

My research interests are in experimental and computational mechanics and multi-scale modeling with applications to geomechanics, fracture mechanics, and fluid flow simulations. I am also a great fan of Python programming, and I will post my observations and relevant ideas on it in my [Blog](category/blog.html).
